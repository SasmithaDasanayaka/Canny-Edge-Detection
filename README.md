# Canny-Edge-Detection
Canny edge detection algorithm using python

## Problem statement:
Identify edges of an image.

## Solution:
Canny edge detection is to detect the edges of an image by doing following steps.
1) Convert the image to gray scale
2) Do gaussian filtering
3) Use sobel to find gradients
4) Find direction and angle of maximum gradients in each pixel
5) Non maximum suppression
6) Double thresholding step.
